Pipelines are Jenkins jobs enabled by the Pipeline (formerly called "workflow") plugin and built with simple text scripts that use a Pipeline DSL (domain-specific language) based on the Groovy programming language.

Pipelines leverage the power of multiple steps to execute both simple and complex tasks according to parameters that you establish. Once created, pipelines can build code and orchestrate the work required to drive applications from commit to delivery.
